After the battle, the Rifians advanced eastward and overran more than 130 Spanish blockhouses. The Spanish garrisons were destroyed without mounting a coordinated response to the attacks. By the end of August, Spain had lost all the territories that it had gained in the area since 1909. General Silvestre disappeared and his remains were never found. According to one report, Spanish sergeant Francisco Basallo Becerra from the Kandussi garrison, an outpost east of Annual, identified the remains of Silvestre by his general's sash. A Moorish courier from Kaddur Namar said that eight days after the battle, he saw the corpse of the general lying face down on the battlefield and still recognizable by his sash and epaulettes.;;;;;;x

EVTDESC19000127;In July 1909, Spanish workers constructing a rail-bridge providing access to iron mines near Melilla were attacked by Rifian tribesmen. This incident led to the summoning of reinforcements from Spain itself. A series of skirmishes over the following weeks cost the Spanish over a thousand casualties. By September, the Spanish Army had 40,000 troops in northern Morocco and had occupied the tribal regions to the south and southeast of Melilla. The military operations in Jebala, in the Moroccan west, began in 1911 with the Larache landing. Spain worked to pacify a large part of the most violent areas until 1914, a slow process of consolidation of frontiers that lasted until 1919, due to World War I. The following year, after the signing of the Treaty of Fez, the northern Moroccan area was adjudicated to Spain as a protectorate. The Riffian populations strongly resisted the Spanish, unleashing a conflict that would last for several years.;;;;;;;x

The ground beneath our feet trembles as Lu Bu's unstoppable forces advance with an inexorable determination. His army, a formidable and disciplined force, leaves no room for opposition. The clash of steel, the thunderous hooves of cavalry, and the roar of siege engines reverberate across the landscape as cities crumble in the wake of his conquering horde. The conquered territories are subjected to a brutal occupation. Cities once thriving with life now lay in ruins, their streets stained with the blood of both combatants and innocent civilians.

Today marks a historic chapter as forces from various nations joined together to face the formidable adversary head-on.The battle reached its climax as the coalition's forces managed to encircle and isolate Lu Bu from his command center. Despite his legendary combat skills, the Warlord found himself overwhelmed by the sheer force of the coordinated assault. The turning tide became apparent as the allied generals strategically exploited weaknesses in Lu Bu's defenses, gradually wearing down his forces. As the dust settled on the battlefield, the once indomitable Lu Bu was forced to concede defeat. The international coalition emerged victorious, marking the end of an era defined by tyranny and unbridled ambition. The conquered territories, long held captive by fear, erupted in a mixture of relief and jubilation as news of the coalition's success spread.;;;;;;x

Let it be known that my patience wears thin, and the time for negotiation is swiftly closing its door. I, Lu Bu, Warlord of the, demand your immediate and unconditional surrender. Your defiance has not gone unnoticed, but your feeble attempts at resistance will only prolong the agony that awaits you. Should you choose to ignore this final warning, the consequences shall be severe and unforgiving. My forces are relentless, and I will not hesitate to unleash the full fury of my wrath upon your lands. You will witness the annihilation of all you hold dear ? your armies will crumble, your cities will burn, and your people will be subjected to a fate so gruesome that it will be spoken of in hushed tones for generations to come. Do not delude yourself into thinking that help will come to your aid, for I have cast a shadow so vast that no ally can emerge from it. Resistance is futile, and your only sensible course of action is to submit to my will. Surrender now, and perhaps I will be merciful in victory. Delay, and you shall face a calamity that will haunt the annals of history as a testament to your arrogance and folly. Choose wisely, for the consequences of your decision are upon you.;;;;;;x

The devastation wrought by Lu Bu's conquest is not only physical but also psychological. The people are left traumatized, their sense of security shattered. The scars of war run deep, and the conquered country is forever changed by the ruthless ambition of Lu Bu and his insatiable lust for power. The legacy of his conquest serves as a grim reminder of the price paid by those who dared to oppose the might of the Warlord.;;;;;;;x

modernize_russia_desc;When Alexander II ascended the throne in 1855, the largely peasant conscripted army in the Crimean war was a national disgrace, and clearly demonstrated that despite its large size, the Russian army was no longer competitive to smaller industrial powers such as Britain and France. The demand for reform was widespread, but unorganized. There had been little consideration of how the complex economic, social, political, and legal roles of the service would be ended. The Tsar decided to abolish serfdom from above, setting up a new system whereby the state would be able to purchase farmland from the landowners and sell it to the freed serfs. The Tsar told Moscow nobles: "Better that the reform should come from above than wait until serfdom is abolished from below. Historians have debated Alexander's role. Soviet era historians downplayed him, as they believed social forces caused history not individuals. Non-Marxist critics say he did not go far enough, especially since he rejected any parliament or duma.;;;;;;;;x

Two years before his dismissal, he briefly met with French emperor Napoleon III in Paris, where he was approached by conservative Mexican monarchists seeking a European royal to rule Mexico. Initially Maximilian was not interested, but following his dismissal as viceroy, the Mexican monarchists' plan was far more appealing to him.;;;;;;;;x

persian_rugs_title;Revive the Silk Industry;;;;;;;x
persian_rugs_desc;Safavid textiles are praised as the pinnacle of Iranian loom weaving. When the Safavids came to power at the turn of the sixteenth century, the Iranian textile industry was already well developed in the production and sale of woven silk textiles and rugs as well as raw silk for export. The textile industry consisted of urban workshops producing textiles independently, provincial centers focusing on rug weaving, and small farms cultivating silk in the Caspian region. As the Safavids set up their capital cities of Tabriz, Qazvin, and finally Isfahan, the textile industry became centralized and was swiftly incorporated into the national economy, creating an expansive revenue stream. After the death of Shah eAbbas in 1629, the Safavid dynasty began to lose central power, and regional governance relegated the monarch to the position of a figurehead. Textile production in court-sponsored workshops declined, while the private sector of the textile industry regained independence, producing silks for the expanding international demand. From the last quarter of the seventeenth century until the dynastyfs end following the Afghan invasion in 1722, there was a marked change in the textiles produced as Iranian weavers stepped down their aesthetic and working methods to suit the tastes and economy of the declining regime.;;;;;;;;x
